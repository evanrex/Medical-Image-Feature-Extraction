# Medical-Image-Feature-Extraction

An open question for certain tasks in the Medical AI and Computer Vision space is
whether pre-training on domain-specific data yields a statistically significant improve-
ment in performance as opposed to pre-training on non-domain-specific data. One such
task where this question is yet unanswered is that of diagnosing COVID19 from chest
Computed Tomography (CT) scans. A further question is what pre-training methods
might be effective in bringing about this improvement. In this paper, we show that for
the downstream task of COVID19 classification, pre-training a ResNet50 model with
the self-supervised learning technique of DINO on an unlabelled domain-specific data
set of fewer than 100 000 CT images yields a statistically significant improvement over
using a model with pre-trained ImageNet weights. The Area Under the Receiver Op-
erating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) is used to quantify this performance, while
Permutation Testing is used to show that the increase is statistically significant.

# Reproducibility

We use slurm to run our experiments, see this [sbatch file](https://github.com/evanrex/Medical-Image-Feature-Extraction/blob/main/models/baseline/train_baseline.sbatch) for reference.
